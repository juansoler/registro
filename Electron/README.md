# Electron Version of Registro

This folder contains a prototype of the Registro application implemented with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). It reimplements the original Java Swing app using web technologies.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the application

```bash
npm start
```

## Status

The prototype now includes basic user management and the ability to registrar nuevas entradas. It runs as root using Electron's `--no-sandbox` flag. Features from the Java version are still incomplete but expanding.
